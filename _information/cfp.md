We are pleased to announce the 19th edition of the Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) conference to be held in Daegu, Korea in July 10-14, 2023. This will be the first time that RSS is taking place in Asia. 

RSS is a single-track conference that connects researchers working on all aspects of robotics including scientific foundations, mechanisms, algorithms, applications, and analysis of robotic systems. The single-track format gives attendees an opportunity to learn about state-of-the-art research in all areas of robotics. The conference will consist of oral and poster presentations of accepted papers, demonstrations, invited talks, and panels. 

The conference will preserve the RSS tradition of selecting excellent papers via a thorough and fair review process. Paper submissions will be evaluated in terms of their novelty, technical quality, significance, potential impact, and clarity.

RSS also features a series of vibrant and engaging workshops across a diverse range of topics. The workshops are a highlight of the conference and offer participants an opportunity to discuss bleeding-edge topics in depth with renowned experts.

This year the conference will include a new category of contributions in the form of Demos, similar to conferences in related research areas, resulting in a Demo Track during the main conference. 

## Important Dates
  *   February 3 11:59pm <a href="https://time.is/Anywhere_on_Earth">AoE</a>, 2023:         Paper and Demo Submission Deadline
  *   February 17 11:59pm <a href="https://time.is/Anywhere_on_Earth">AoE</a>, 2023:       Workshop Submission Deadline
  *   March 17, 2023:           Workshop Acceptance Notification
  *   April 22, 2023:               Paper and Demo Acceptance Notification
  *   July 10 - July 14, 2023: RSS 2023, Daegu, Korea

Detailed submission instructions will be made available under the conference website in December 2023.


## Highlights of RSS 2023

  *   RSS 2023 is planned as an in-person conference, excluding any unexpected developments with the COVID-19 pandemic or similar unfortunate global events.

  *  A new type of submission, Demos, will be available to RSS 2023 contributors. These single-blind submissions can range from early research demos (e.g., innovative, proof-of-concept given the state-of-the-art) to mature production-ready systems (e.g., accessible, large-scale industrial systems). Open-source and open-access systems or interactive systems that are accessible by the community are especially encouraged. Demos can relate to hardware or software contributions or their integration. They can also relate to critical system components and useful tools for the community. The deadline and the review process for demos will take place in parallel with the review of regular RSS paper submissions.  Detailed submission instructions will be made available under the conference website in December 2023.

  *   The review process will continue RSS' strong tradition in emphasizing care, quality, fairness, and rigor. Reviews for RSS papers, including both for “science” and “systems” papers, will remain double-blind. A subset of authors will be invited by Area Chairs to submit a rebuttal. Author rebuttals will be directed to the ACs and considered during the program committee meeting. As in previous iterations of the conference, authors are encouraged to submit “systems” papers and the program committee will be encouraged to evaluate them by gauging their potential impact and usefulness to the community. 

  *   RSS maintains a strong on-going relationship with top robotics journals. Authors of RSS papers have been invited in the past to submit papers to the International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR), Autonomous Robots (AuRo) and the IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO).

## Subject Areas

RSS seeks high-quality research papers and demos that introduce new ideas and stimulate future trends in robotics. We invite paper and demo submissions in all areas of robotics, including: 

(Domains:) Assembly, Logistics and Manufacturing; Assistive Robots; Autonomous Vehicle Navigation; Field Robotics (e.g., Aerial, Agricultural, Construction, Space, Underwater Robotics); Medical Robots; Grasping and Manipulation; Human-Robot Interaction; Locomotion; Multi-Robot and Networked Systems; Service Robots; 

(Robot Components, Tools and Methods:) Bioinspired Robots; Control and Dynamics; Cognitive Modeling and Knowledge Representation; Formal Methods; Machine Learning; Mechanisms and Design; Modeling and Simulation; Perception, Sensors and Vision; Planning; Soft Actuators; State Estimation (e.g., Localization and Mapping).
